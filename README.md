# Constructing Sturdy UIs with xstate

This is the course material for my workshop: _Constructing Sturdy UIs with xstate_

## Pre-Workshop Instructions

- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] From a command line run: `git clone https://github.com/isaacplmann/sturdy-uis.git`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
- [ ] Make sure that you can run the application with `yarn start` or `npm start`
- [ ] Shortly before the workshop, run `git fetch --all` and `git pull` on the master branch

## Requirements

- Familiarity with any component based front end framework. We will be using xstate in the context of a React app, but will not be digging deep into anything React specific. Our focus will be on the state machines.

## Optional pre-reading

- xstate docs: https://xstate.js.org/docs/
- xstate visualizer: https://xstate.js.org/viz/
- Glossary of terms: https://statecharts.github.io/glossary/ (Don't study these. Just use it as a reference if needed.)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
